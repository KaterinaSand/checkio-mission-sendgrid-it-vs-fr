        How to start here?

    <div class="answer">
        You should use <a href="https://py.checkio.org/projects/open/sendgrid/hint-statistics-advanced/">/geo/stats</a> in order to get information about clicks and opens grouped by country. The API contains two-digit country count; this is what we are looking for.
