    <div class="answer">
        You should use <a href="https://py.checkio.org/projects/open/sendgrid/hint-statistics-advanced/">/geo/stats</a> in order to get information about clicks and opens grouped by country. The API contains two-digit country count; this is what we are looking for.

        If start date and end date are the same you will receive information for one day only. And this is what what we are looking for.
